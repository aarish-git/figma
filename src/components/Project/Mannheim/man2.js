                  The building architecture and the proposed modernization posed a risk of the building interiors heating up unevenly. Also, there was uncertainty about the existing HVAC system's capacity to supply the required cooling load. Addressing these challenges was key to ensuring that the contractual obligation with the tenant to maintain a comfortable temperature was fulfilled.
